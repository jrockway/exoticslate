<h1>Exotic Slate</h1>
<p>
Exotic Slate is an Open Source Software fork of the previously Open Source
wiki product, from Socialtext, Inc.
</p>
<p>
In April 2009, Socialtext withdrew its repository on GitHub
(http://github.com/socialtext/socialtext/) from being open to the public.
This fork was made, in case people wanted to continue open development of
Socialtext.
</p>
<p>
Socialtext is a very good product, and is written over open technology. This
code in its current state, is not easily installable, but could be made to be
with some work.
</p>
<p>
The word "Socialtext" is almost an anagram of the word "Exotic Slate",
except it is missing an 'e'.
