Test case to test `/data/workspaces`

* Fixture: SocialRest

This test case assumes a logged in user.

Test set up:

| comment | STARTING Test case: REST Workspace Permissions |  |

| comment | we have 3 admins and seven permissions sets. accounts-admin updates 2 permission sets, system-admin updates two other permission sets, workspace-admin updates the final 3 permissions sets. This gives us good coverage (all admins, all permissions). Having every admin update every permission set (21 operations) would take a long time for very little advantage. |  |
