Test case to verify that deleting an LDAP user from their LDAP store removes all effective access.

* Fixture: OpenLDAP

Bug 365: Logged in LDAP user still has access when account is deleted

This test case assumes the following:

* OpenLDAP fixture has been bootstrapped and is running
* test workspace has been configured as "member-only"

Also, you need base_dn.ldif in your wikitest_files directory.

| *Comment* | Test Case: LDAP Deleted User |  |

| *Comment* | Setup: turn LDAP caching off, otherwise this test takes forever to run |  |
| ldap-config | ttl | 0 |

| *Comment* | Setup: add framework to LDAP store; create arbitrary user in LDAP |  |
| add-ldif-data | %%wikitest_files%%base_dn.ldif |  |
| set | test_user | user_%%start_time%% |
| add-ldap-user | %%test_user%% |  |
| set | test_email | %%test_user%%@example.com |
| set | test_username | %%test_user%% LdapUser |
| set | test_password | ldapd3v |

| *Comment* | Setup: add the user to the workspace and create a page to test against |  |
| st-admin | add-member --email %%test_email%% --workspace %%workspace%% |  |
| st-admin | update-page --email %%test_email%% --workspace %%workspace%% --page "eraseme %%start_time%%" < %%wikitest_client_files%%wikitest.txt | page has been created |

| *Comment* | Test case: LDAP user can login |  |
| st-login | %%test_username%% | %%test_password%% |

| *Comment* | Test case: user is treated as being logged in; "Edit" button is present, and so is "Logout" link |  |
| open_ok | /%%workspace%%/index.cgi?action=recent_changes |  |
| text_like | Changes in Last |  |
| wait_for_element_visible_ok | st-wikinav-logout | 30000 |

| *Comment* | DELETE user from LDAP directory |  |
| remove-ldap-user | %%test_user%% |  |

| *Comment* | Test case: now deleted user should be treated as *not* logged in |  |
| refresh |  |  |
| wait_for_page_to_load_ok | 30000 |  |
| st-message | You must login to view this page |  |

| *Comment* | Test case: should not be able to log in as now deleted LDAP user |  |
| st-login | %%test_username%% | %%test_password%% |
| st-message | Wrong email address or password - please try again. |  |

| *Comment* | Teardown: remove the user and the new page we created |  |
| st-admin | remove-member --email %%test_email%% --workspace %%workspace%% | no longer a member |
| st-admin | purge-page --workspace %%workspace%% --page "eraseme_%%start_time%%" | page was purged |
