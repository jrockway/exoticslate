NOTE:  This file is not complete.  It's a scratch pad for notes as we
work on porting.

== Order of install ==

== Problems ==

Crypt::SSLeay doesn't build OK on its own

SOAP::Lite has special stuff we need

perl-Crypt-SSLeay

** MAKE A PACKAGE LIST **

The SOAP::Lite that is on SuSe 10.1 is 0.66, and we need at least 0.67.
