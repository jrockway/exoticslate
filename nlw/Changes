Change log for Socialtext Open

2.15.X

Release notes, 2.15.0.0  Sept 2007

  [FEATURES]
  
  This release applies the CPAL license to the open source release. 

  All static resources like css files, javascript files and UI images like rounded corners now
  get expires headers setting the expiration to 10 years out.  This is to increase use of browser and
  proxy caches of the rather largish combined-source.js file.  Note that all of these resources all use
  versioned URIs like /static/X.X.X.X/resource-name.ext so when Socialtext gets upgraded, new resources
  will come along.

  Unplugged Enabled is now the default and a migration was provided that will enable it for
  all existing workspaces.

  [BUGS]
  rt-26744 - An infinite loop could be created with the caching of breadcrumb trails.  Similar
  yet different from rt-25330.

  rt-26839 - An index was added to the UserId table for the driver_key, driver_unique_id columns.  This
  speeds up lookups for User information significantly on installations with large user bases.

  Previous releases since 2.11.6.1 added:
 
  * WikiWidgets
  * Japanese localization
  * interwiki search 
  * Miki login support 


  Other features and bug fixes in 2.14:

  * Uploading bmp images now works like any other image 
  * Allow homepage to redirect to a weblog
  * bug fix for IE "white screen" errors
  * bug fix for tab completion of tags
   
   Other features and bug fixes in 2.12:

   * Socialtext Unplugged was upgraded with a number of bug fixes,
      particularly to sync when reconnected
   * Included pages better integrated into the look of including pages
   * Backlinks now detect and link to page includes
   * Page rename will now honor case changes in page titles
   * IE 6 no longer freezes when Edit immediately follows Upload files
   * GMail no longer ignores Subject during Email To This Page
   * Neither page headers nor footers are added during PDF/Word export
   * A bug that prevented PDF/Word export under SSL on Internet Explorer was
      repaired
   * Email sent from Socialtext wikis are more robustly formatted to get
    * through spam filters
   * The code no longer uses Mason

2.11.6.1

    [FEATURES]

    This version introduces pluggability for authentication, allowing for
    alternate challenge systems such as OpenID (coming soon) or alternate
    credentials extraction systems.

    Additionally, this version introduces export to word and pdf.  More 
    information on this can be found on the following page:

    https://www.socialtext.net/help/index.cgi?release_notes_for_socialtext_2_11_export_to_word_and_pdf

    Instructions for using OpenID are here:

Synced with ST-based trunk -r14912

2.5.0.2     Fri Dec 15 10:58:39 CST 2006

    [FEATURES]

    Socialtext Unplugged is a way of creating an "airplane" wiki that
    allows a user to "unplug" some segment of pages from a wiki, take
    them away offline, edit them, and resynch them back to the workspace
    when the user returns to the Internet.

    The code being released is of beta quality. It has been developed so
    it is only available to those workspaces which have been configured
    to use it.  The Socialtext Unplugged capability can be turned on in
    a workspace with the following st-admin command:

        st-admin set-workspace-config --workspace <workspace name> enable_unplugged 1

    This will cause an unplug icon to be displayed on page displays,
    recent changes lists, watchlist displays and some other page listing
    screens. When the unplug icon is clicked, a zipped archive of those
    pages will be saved to the user's computer. Inside that archive is
    a file named index.html that, when opened, is a TiddlyWiki version
    of the pages that were unplugged.

    Socialtext Unplugged currently works best with Firefox.  The results
    pages with Internet Explorer are a bit unclear, and Safari doesn't
    work at all yet.

    For more about Socialtext Unplugged, see the FAQ at
    https://www.socialtext.net/exchange/index.cgi?socialtext_unplugged_faq


    [FIXES]
    Reversed the change in 2.3.0.1 that changes how config files are included.
    Now, Apache Includes conf.d/*.conf as before.

    Undeleting a page with utf8 characters in the title caused an app error.

    Removed a stray period from the end of a line in the email template
    so that the link works if you click it in all mail clients.

    The "Duplicate page" popup now sets focus to the name field.

    Nav bar was missing when invalid action returns to homepage.

    Orphans list action now works correctly.

    Rationalized link ordering in nav bar and list view.

    Fixed incorrect instructions on My Workspaces interface page.

    Images with a query string would not get displayed.
    
    Included Socialtext::InitFunctions

    [INTERNALS]
    Socialtext::WeblogUpdates was getting loaded into Apache
    unnecessarily.

    Setting of default values of server-admin and support-address are
    now done in build/defaults.pl, instead of configure.

    The t/*.t tests have been streamlined in some cases to use fewer test
    fixtures.  All I did on this branch was review the tests and try to
    make them use fewer fixtures. For example, there were several tests
    using the "workspaces" fixture that only needed "admin" or "foobar".


2.3.1.0     Mon Nov 27 11:57:18 CST 2006

    This is an important update that fixes two big bugs in 2.3.0.1.

    [FIXES]
    File attachment uploads and page tagging didn't work because their
    handlers were missing in the Apache config.

    Fixed filename of the Excel worksheet extractor.

    The ConfigureValues.pm file was getting created at the wrong time.

    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    XML::SAX is now optional, not required.  This saves two CPAN
    distributions to install.


2.3.0.1     Mon Nov 20 12:57:26 CST 2006

    [FEATURES]

    Tags may now be deleted.  Tags that are not used on any page are
    automatically removed. To delete an unwanted tag, go to the list
    of tags, view all pages with that tag, and remove the tag from any
    pages that contain it.

    Improved support for HTML email. When a user sends rich email to the
    workspace, it is converted to formatted wikitext with inline images.

    Brought back the option to see "recently viewed" and "what's new"
    in sidebar boxes, temporarily removed in Socialtext 2.0.

    Extensive new searching features for file attachments.  With optional
    external programs installed, the Socialtext page indexer can also
    index the contents of many different file types, including:
        * Microsoft Word and Excel documents
        * RTF, PDF and PostScript documents
        * HTML documents
        * MP3 audio
        * generic XML documents
        * compressed zip files

    The REST API has been updated.  Primary new features include:
        * /data/workspaces/:ws/homepage redirects to the current homepage
          of the workspace
        * /data/version contains the version number of the API
        * page collections have better titles
        * collections now support order=alpha
        * attachments are sortable by name (alpha) and size
        * utf8 path names are allowed
        * JSON representation is available for PUTting pages (helps with
          wiki imports)
        * when retrieving a JSON representation of a workspace, admins get
          a bunch of good info, non-admins get a small amount of information
          (still useful)
        * Dynamically generated WSDL file, instead of a statically
          served file.

    The list view that shows pages with a specific tag now enables
    column sorting.

    Reduced the size of headings.  Headings (H1-H6) are, in general, too
    large. As a result users often resort to starting with H2 or H3. That
    breaks any chance of meaningful hierarchical data in wikitext. Users
    are breaking semantics to get desired look-and-feel.

    We now show tags in revision views.

    The parameters for Apache::SizeLimit are now set in the httpd.conf.
    These are read by Socialtext::Handler::Cleanup at startup time.
    No more hardcoded values in the .pm files.

    Includes in the Apache *.conf files now include "[^.#]*", instead of
    the more limiting "*.conf".

    In the "Save As" box for downloading attachments, we now suggest
    a filename.

    [FIXES]
    An old version of Text::Balanced was causing attachment indexing
    to slow down because of the use of the $& special variable.  We now
    require v1.99.0 of Text::Balanced that doesn't cause this problem.

    User was able to add a tag while editing a page, which would stay
    even if the page was canceled.

    Tag deletion used to increment the revision number.

    If you click on the "Your Watchlist" link on the dashboard, you are
    taken to the watchlist page, but the Watchlist tab is not highlighted.
    Now fixed.

    Show "1 view" instead of "1 views".

    Many other smaller fixes, and fixes in import-workspace and
    export-workspace.


    [DOCUMENTATION]
    Added .html to the Edit Tips refcard page.

    Added permissions note to the UPGRADE docs.  Thanks to Dobrica
    Pavlinusic for catching the error.


    [INTERNALS]
    All config files are now generated with Template Toolkit.

    Removed unused /st-archive handler from Socialtext Open.

    Added the --server-admin parameter to set the ServerAdmin parameter
    in the Apache config.

    Added the --support-address parameter to set the default support
    address if it's not set in /etc/socialtext/socialtext.conf.

    Removed dependency on File::Copy::Recursive.

    Removed HTTP::BrowserDetect, replaced it with four lines of code in
    two functions in Socialtext::BrowserDetect.  Saves 889K bytes of
    memory usage in mod_perl.

    Socialtext::Workspace::Importer no longer gets loaded in Apache,
    since it's only used by the st-import-workspace utility.  Another 118K
    saved.

    All Perl and Javascript files now have copyright notices, plus
    a t/copyright.t test to make sure new ones don't get added
    without copyright.


    [DEVELOPMENT]
    Added an explicit --dev option to configure.  This is now available
    as get_build_setting('dev').

    Removed Apache::Reload as a prerequisite, unless you configure
    with --dev.

    dev-bin/list-module-deps now lets you pass --dev and --socialtext-open
    options, which will load DevDeps.yaml and omit EnterpriseDeps.yaml,
    respectively.

    Added a test file so that all .t files have shebang lines, strict
    and warnings.


2.0.0.1     Sat Nov  4 23:15:06 CST 2006

    Changes here are massive, since it includes all our Socialtext 2.0
    improvements.  They won't all be listed here.

    [FIXES]
    Removed a warning in the error log if apache-perl wasn't forwarded.

    [INTERNALS]
    Added t/case-conflict.t to watch for filenames that differ only
    in case.  This protects against conflicts on case-insensitive
    filesystems like HFS on Mac OS X.

    Updated all the Test::Socialtext-using programs to use the new
    fixture()-as-a-function method of specifying fixtures.

    Made the tests that use Test::MockObject skip_all if T::MO isn't
    installed.  We don't want to make another module install requirement
    for three tests.

--- Socialtext 1.x ---

1.10.7.4    Fri Sep 29 16:37:29 CDT 2006

    [FIXES]
    Fixed a potential problem with configure hanging.  Thanks, Luke Closs.

    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    The /etc/init.d/ scripts now work on Fedora Core.

    You can now specify the locate of your Apache module directories with
    --apache-perl-moduledir and --apache2-moduledir at ./configure time.
    This also removes the directory hunting from gen-config.

    Apache config no longer loads the mod_cgi module, since everything
    goes through mod_perl anyway.

    Removed more unused files that were only useful inside Socialtext
    the company.

    Removed all experimental code for FCGI and lighttpd.

    [DOCUMENTATION]
    Extensive docs on BSD now in docs/INSTALL.freebsd.  Thanks to
    Jason Crome.


1.10.7.1 Tue Sep 19 22:16:59 CDT 2006

This release incoroporates some bug fixing work done on the main line
of work inside Socialtext.  We're working towards some big new REST
API improvements.

    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    Added st-admin --rename-workspace.

    Added --no-export flag for st-admin delete-workspace.

    Easier to understand sign-in/invitation emails

    [FIXES]
    The Apache status ExtendedStatus directive was in the wrong part of
    the apache-perl config file.

    Bug #19943: Deleted pages were showing up in searches.


1.10.5.1 Fri Sep 15 23:44:09 CDT 2006

This release works hard to improve portability and efficiency of memory
usage.  Not everyone has a couple of gigs to throw at their wiki server,
so we've been cleaning things up a bit.

The /etc/init.d scripts should now work whether you're running a
Debian-based distro, like Ubuntu, or a RedHat or SuSe distro.

A reminder: If you're using Socialtext Open on a public site, please add
it to https://www.socialtext.net/stoss/index.cgi?socialtext_open_sites.
We'd love to see who's using Socialtext Open.


    [THINGS THAT MAY BREAK YOUR CODE]

    Removed the /etc/init.d/ceqlotron wrapper around /etc/init.d/st-apache
    and /etc/init.d/ceqlotron.  If you already have a Socialtext install,
    delete your /etc/init.d/socialtext, and instead use the st-apache
    and ceqlotron init scripts directly.


    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    /etc/init.d scripts should now run whether your system uses
    start-stop-daemon (Debian, Ubuntu), startproc (Red Hat, SuSe),
    or neither.

    Added /status and /perl-status URLs when configured with
    --apache-status.

    The user/group that ST runs on is now configurable with --st-user
    and --st-group flags to configure.

    No longer tries to load unused Apache modules: autoindex, status,
    db_auth.

    Removed unused handlers etc. from the Apache configurations.

    Socialtext::Ceqltron was getting loaded by Apache when it shouldn't
    have.

    Updated the invitation email to not be so likely to trip spam
    triggers.

    st-admin --help is now much easier to read.


    [FIXES]
    Installer is smarter and won't try to install vim backup files
    as scripts.

    Added "bc" package to the required package lists.

    Fixed some errors in the help documentation.

    Many other little bug fixes.


1.10.4.1    Wed Aug 30 15:25:13 CDT 2006

Socialtext Open is a major new release, with a new REST API available,
albeit in alpha stage.

This also allows you take advantage of the Socialtext Conversion Toolbox
(https://www.socialtext.net/stoss/index.cgi?socialtext_conversion_toolbox)
for converting from other wiki packages.

    [FIXES]
    Fixed dependency on Test::Base.

    [IMPROVEMENTS]
    Removed dependencies on File::Find::Rule, Number::Compare and
    Text::Glob.

    Removed specific version dependency on Carp.

    [INTERNALS]
    Removed dependency on Socialtext::AppConfig in Socialtext::File.

    Removed dev-bin/deptree.  It is now included in the CPAN
    distribution Module::Depends::Tree.

    Values defined by configure are now contained/restricted to
    Socialtext::Build::ConfigureValues.

    All calls to GetOptions() die if any invalid options are passed.


1.10.0.5    Fri Aug 11 21:29:10 CDT 2006

    [IMPROVEMENTS]
    If --hostname is specific when calling ./configure, it is now
    passed into /etc/socialtext/socialtext.conf as email_hostname and
    web_hostname.

    Removed the dependency on Plucene::Simple.  Plucene::Simple is now
    integrated into Socialtext::Search::Plucene::Simple.

    Removing Plucene::Simple also removed five dependent modules.


1.10.0.4    Wed Aug  9 22:15:37 CDT 2006

This is the first version we're not calling "beta".

    [IMPROVEMENTS]
    Removed 9 module dependencies, to help minimize install times.

    [FIXED]
    Fixed some tests that may have failed on some systems, depending on
    if you had Image::Magick or elinks installed.

    [DOCUMENTATION]
    Added documentation to INSTALL about the test user and test
    database that you need to have in Postgres.



1.10.0.3-beta   Fri Aug  4 16:00:40 CDT 2006

Configuration has changed slightly.  Now, if your HOSTNAME isn't fully
qualified, you can specify it before calling ./configure.  It used to
be you'd specify URL, but this is simpler, as in:

    HOSTNAME=mywiki.mysite.com ./configure

You only need to do this if your hostname is just the host's name, as in
"mywiki".

    [FIXES]
    Fixed a problem with redirections in the Apache configuration file.
    Also removed many extraneous mod_rewrite directives that aren't used
    for Socialtext Open.  Thanks, David Singer.

    The /var/run/socialtext directory is now created and given correct
    permissions on install.  Thanks, David Singer.

    Apache::SizeLimit is no longer required.

    Fixed a performance issue with Recent Changes.


1.10.0.2-beta   Thu Aug  3 15:00:19 CDT 2006

    [FIXES]
    Bug #1530704: Regex for URL doesn't allow dash in t/page-to-absolute.t

    [FEATURES]
    Updated to include features most recently in v1.10.1.1 on the
    hosted service.

    [DOCUMENTATION]
    Updates to the INSTALL file.


1.10.0.0-beta   Mon Jul 24 07:24:06 PDT 2006

    The first public beta of Socialtext Open.
